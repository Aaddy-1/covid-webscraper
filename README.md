# covid-webscraper
This simple python script scrapes the website worldometers.info for covid case data and compiles them into a csv file. I have also included a sample csv file to show how the compiled data will look like.
Planned updates for this project include an option for daily, weekly, and hourly refreshes to the data, and an option to graph the data to show the trends of the disease spread in these countries.
